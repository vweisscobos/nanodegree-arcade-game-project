during the given time and avoid to collide with the enemies. 
- Each time you complete a cross and reach the water, the enemies becomes faster
- Every time you get hit by an enemy, one cross you decreased from your score
- If your score is zero and you get hit, you loose the game
- If the timeout reaches zero, the game ends
